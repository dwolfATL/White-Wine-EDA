# White-Wine-EDA

## Exploratory Data Analysis on a white wine dataset

##### Project 3 in my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

This project is my first foray into Exploratory Data Analysis using R. What a rewarding experience! There's not much I need to say in the README, since the project itself includes my thought process as I characterized a set of white wine data. The RMD file includes the R chunks and markdown text used to create the final HTML file. The original dataset is available at the link below.
